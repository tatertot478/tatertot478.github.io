<h2><font color="blue"><a name = "about"></a>About me</font></h2>
	<img src= "file:///Users/tate/Downloads/me.jpeg" height= 150/>
		<p> My name is Tate. I am 23 years old, and have lived in orange county all my life. I enjoy
		going to the beach, seeing movies, playing video games, and most of all <strong>rock climbing.</strong>
		I live with 2 roomates in a small apartment in costa mesa, and plan on one day moving up to Sacramento
		to be near my<em> girlfriend</em> and her family. I have both a mac and a PC, but because I'm almost
		always working and on the go, I use my macbook air the vast majority of the time. I'm running the High
		Sierra operating system, and wifi wherever I can get it <em>(work, my apartment, starbucks, etc)</em></p1>

		<p>Since I have such a busy schedule, I've had to prioritize my hobbies based on how much time they consume and how important they are to me.
		If I had to rank my top 3 hobbies, I think they would be in this order:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Rock Climbing</li>
			<li>Video Games</li>
			<li>Good Movies</li>
		</ol>

<h2><font color="orange"><a name = "education"></a>Education</font></h2>
		<p>I graduated Huntington Beach High School in 2013. I then attended Vanguard University,
		and am currently in the process of recieving my BA of Cultural Anthropology. I actually just need 18 more units of
		electives in order to graduate, but as I work a full-time job, I need to complete then via online classes.
		So this is my first and only semester at OCC. It's proving to be quite difficult to manage a job on top of classes,
		and I have come to realize how helpful in-person teaching was. Being forced to manage my time, and find my
		own solutions to problems is proving to be a bit tricky, but it is also really helping me grow my skills
		 </p1>
		 
		 <br/>
		 <br/>
		 <p3>In addidtion to this class, I'm also taking online classes in:</p3>
		 <ul>
			<li> <em>Applied Management </em></li>
				<li> <em>Real Estate Principals</em></li>
					<li> <em>Into to Entrepreneurship </em></li>
						<li> <em>English Critical Thinking</em></li>
		 </ul>

	<p>I currently work as an Executive Assistant at David August. You might know us for our "FU" suits that Connor McGregor
		is fond of.<br/>
		<em>(I really hope this doesn't offend anyone)</em> 
		</p> As an Executive Assistant, I have a pretty wide range of responsibilities.
	
		<ul>
			<li> <em>Booking appointments</em></li>
				<li> <em>Photography of suit collections</em></li>
					<li> <em>Meeting and "selling" high profile clients</em></li>
						<li> <em>Creating digital wardrobe books</em></li>

<p>Before working with David August, I was a rock climbing instructor for 5 years. I even taught the OCC rock climbing class for awhile!</p>
